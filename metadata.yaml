title: "Researches on curves of the second order\r\nAlso on cones and spherical conics\
  \ treated analytically, in which the tangencies of Apollonius are investigated,\
  \ and general geometrical constructions deduced from analysis; also several of the\
  \ geometrical conclusions of M. Chasles are analytically resolved, together with\
  \ many properties entirely original"
